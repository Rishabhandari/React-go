1.Super(): It is used to call the constructor of its parent class. 
This is required when we need to access some variables of its parent class.

2. Props: It is a special keyword that is used in react stands for properties. Used for passing data from one component to another. 
Props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

FOR STATES
1. always make use of set state and never modify state directly
2.code executed just after set state get the recent state of variables
3.when you want to update statebased on previous state , pass in function in setstate to get previous state data

For Props
1. Prop passing from child to parent is no way, but we can have a hack for that i.e passing by event handler callback function .
